ðŸ“ˆ Stock Price Prediction & Portfolio Optimisation
Overview

This project explores quantitative finance techniques for stock price modeling and portfolio optimisation.
It combines Monte Carlo simulations, the Black-Litterman model, and Mean-Variance Optimisation (MVO) using both closed-form solutions and quadratic programming.

The aim is to:

Simulate stock price paths using Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM).

Estimate return distributions and risk using log returns.

Optimise portfolio allocation under different assumptions and constraints.
